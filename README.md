# SQLucjan Finance Web Application

## Description
SQLucjan is designed for the Ministry of Finance, transforming natural language inquiries into SQL queries to extract data from databases. Users type their queries in natural language, receive a response from the LLM along with the used SQL query. They can tweak this query and run it to fetch data directly from the database, bypassing the AI. SQLucjan is able to operate offline because of it's modularity, ensuring data security.
